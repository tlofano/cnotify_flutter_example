# CNotify - Flutter App Example

This repository contains a Flutter application that implements the **CNotify SDK** to receive scheduled notifications from the platform.

**CNotify** allows you to create unlimited recurring notifications that can be scheduled using a *No Code* interface, as easily as scheduling an event in G Calendar. For more details about CNotify, visit its [website](https://cnotify.me) and for more technical information, check out the [documentation](https://docs.cnotify.me) (also available in Spanish).

The detailed step-by-step guide to integrate the SDK into a Flutter application is available in the [SDK â†’ Flutter](https://docs.cnotify.me/#/tutorials/SDKs/flutter/flutter) section.
